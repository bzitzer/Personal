DM Method based off of the MAGIC full likelihood method using TMinuit.

Instructions for use:
1. Run VEGAS stages 1 to 6 as normal. 
2. Start ROOT in directory with rootlogon.C 
   > .L dumpStg6Results_wZnCorr.C
   > dumpStg6Results_wZnCorr(<inFile>,<outFile>, <nEvents>,<useRBM>,<theta2Cut>, <NoFromStg5>,<Stg5Path>)
   Where:
      string inFile // Stage 6 ROOT results file
      string outFile // ascii file containing event list
      int nEvents // number of events dumped into file (0, default uses all events)
      bool useRBM // if set to 'true' will use Crescent bg with zenith correction ('RBM' here is a bit of a misnomer)
                  // if set to 'false' will use reflected regions
      double theta2Cut // theta^2 cut 
      bool NoFromStg5 // if set to 'true' will get NSB values from stage 5 file instead of stage 6 file (bug in v251 of VEGAS putting the wrong NSB values in results file)
      string Stg5Path // Path to Stage 5 files (stg 5 files should be named as <Stg5Path>/<runNum>.stg5.root
      
   This puts events with energy, positions, etc. from stage 6 into an ascii file which is used in Alex's event weighting and the maximum likelihood
3. > .L dumpEATextInput.C
   > dumpEATextInput(string InFile,string configPath,bool useMCE = 0, bool testMode = 0,bool useOlder = 0)
   Where:
      string InFile // ascii file created with dumpStg6Results_wZnCorr.C
      string configPath // Path to EA files
      bool useMCE // use MC energies instead of Reconstructed energies. (Should be set to 'true') 
      bool testMode // use only the first 10000 events. (Should be set to 'false')
      bool useOlder // use an older iteration of dumpStg6Results (should be set to 'false') 
4. > .L dumpBiasTextInput.C
   >  dumpBiasTextInput(string InFile,string dir,string configDir,bool testMode = 0,bool useOlder = 0)
   Options same as for step 3.
   
5. Process simulations with zenith and epoch (v4,v5 or v6) closely matching your data set through stages 1-4 of VEGAS as normal.
6. Process sims though stage 5 with the combined tree option
7. For each simulation file:
   > .L dumpPSFHist.C
   > dumpPSFHist(string inFile,string outFile,bool doNorm = false)
   Where: 
      string InFile // ascii file created with dumpStg6Results_wZnCorr.C
      string outFile // ascii out file
      bool doNorm // normalize histograms (should be set to false)

8. The PSF should be convolved with the DM profile:
   > .L calcJFactor_energy.cpp+
   > calcJFactor_energy(string outFile,double thCut)
   Where:
      string outFile // root file which contains histograms and J profile convolved with PSF as a function of energy
      double thCut // Theta cut (note, not theta^2)
   To change the DM profile parameters, edit the code in lines between 544 and 549 for a generalized NFW (or Zhao) profile.
  
 9. Computing DM limits for a single dwarf:
   > .L ZitzTMinuitDM.cpp+
   > ZitzTMinuitDM(string inEventFile = "/raid/reedbuck/bzitzer/Pass5f/segue1_eventList_pass5f_wZnCorr.txt",
		   string inEAFile = "/raid/reedbuck/bzitzer/Pass5f/segue1_eventList_pass5f_stg5noise_nZnCorr.txt.mce",
		   string inJFactorFile = "JPSFtables_alldwarfs/integratedJconvPSF_Seg1.txt",
		   string dispPath = "/raid/reedbuck/bzitzer/Pass5f/segue1_bias/",
		   string outRootFile = "segue_LLDM_outFile.root",dwarf_t dwarf = segue_1)
   Where: 
      string inEventFile // Ascii event file list made in step 2
      string inEAFile // Ascii EA file made in step 3
      string inJFactorFile // root file with J profiles convolved with PSF computed in step 8 (note that this only 
                              takes a single file with a single simulation file)
      string dispPath // Path to directory with energy bias for each run, computed in step 4
      string outRootFile // output root file for keeping likelihood as a function of <sigma nu>, one for each mass as TGraph objects
      dwarf_t dwarf // enumerated type for each dwarf galaxy, options are: segue_1,draco,ursa_minor,bootes and crab (crab only for testing purposes!)

   Note: to change annilhation channel, edit line 59 of the code to change decay_t to another option. 
         decay_t is another enumerated type which defines the channel. options are: WW, ZZ, bbar, tt, ee and uu for W and Z bosons, 
         b quarks, tau leptons, electrons and muons, respectively.
