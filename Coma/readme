Steps for using combined runs method in VEGAS: 
1. Download runs and run VEGAS stages 1-5 as normal. 
2. Run vaStage6 on each run individually in batch mode for both ON and OFF runs. 
  - The script RunVegasStg6Inv.bash can do this. The paths may have to be changed, as well as the configuration files. 
  - Remember to rename the stage 6 results files after each time stage 6 is run. (e.g. results_<run number>_s6.root)
  - If you want to use modified Li&Ma on the matched runs, you must use the option in stage 6 (-RBM_UseModifiedLiMa=1)
  - Info on modified Li&Ma here: https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/wiki/images/9/93/Zitz_systematic_bgmemo.pdf
3. Make an ascii file with the path and stage 6 results file for the ON run and matching OFF run on each run
  - Example:
    $PATH_TO_ON_RUN/results_<on run 1>_s6.root $PATH_TO_OFF_RUN/results_<off run 1>_s6.root
    $PATH_TO_ON_RUN/results_<on run 2>_s6.root $PATH_TO_OFF_RUN/results_<off run 2>_s6.root
    
                        .                                   .
                        .                                   .
                        .                                   .
    $PATH_TO_ON_RUN/results_<on run N>_s6.root $PATH_TO_OFF_RUN/results_<off run N>_s6.root
    
4. Start root in the $VEGAS/macros or $VEGAS/resultsExtractor/macros directory, with the combineMatchedRuns.cpp in the directory
5. Compile the macro: 
    - > combinedMatchedRuns.cpp+
6. Run the macro, with the ascii file created in step 3 as the input. 
    - The option exists to use modifed Li&Ma instead of Li&Ma 17 to calculate significance, if it was run on the stage 6 files first in step 2.
    - Default is Li&Ma 17.
